    Feed.fm allows you to legally add popular music to your mobile app with a Pandora-style
    user interface. This SDK takes care of all communication with the Feed.fm service and
    delivery of music files to the iOS device - you need only set authentication tokens
    and call play, pause, skip, like or dislike on the shared player instance.

    This pod also contains a collection of UI elements that build on top of the core library.
    Sample elements include: play/pause, skip, and like/dislike buttons that update themselves
		automatically; UILabels that marquee and display the active song; and others.

    This pod includes an example app that can be used with 'pod try FeedMedia'
    Documentation for the classes in this package can be found at
